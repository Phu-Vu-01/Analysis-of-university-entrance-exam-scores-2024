# 📊 Analysis of University Entrance Exams in Vietnam (2021-2024)
## 🎯 Introduction and Objectives
University entrance exams in Vietnam determine students' academic futures. This analysis explores datasets from 2021 to 2024 to uncover trends, patterns, and insights. The primary objectives are to:
- Understand score distributions across subjects and years.
- Compare performance trends over the years.
- Analyze the distribution of subject groups A, A1, B, C, and D.
- Identify correlations between subjects and other variables.
## 📂 Dataset
The dataset includes exam scores and student information from 2021 to 2024. These include students' id, scores, year, and province.
##🛠️ Tools Used
🔧 Python
## 🛠️ Implementation
### 🗂️ Data Collection
Collected data from the Ministry of Education and Training and imported it into the project environment.
### 🧹 Data Cleaning
Check Columns: Ensure that all four files (2021, 2022, 2023, 2024) have matching columns.
Verified that each file contains these columns without discrepancies.
Concatenate Files: Combine the four files into a single dataset.
Check for Null Values: Identify and handle missing values.
Remove Duplicates: Ensure there are no duplicate entries in the dataset.
### 📊 Data Analysis
Renamed columns for clarity and created calculated columns to derive additional insights.
Established relationships between different tables (e.g., student demographics and exam scores) to facilitate comprehensive analysis.
Applied statistical techniques, such as correlation analysis, to identify relationships between variables.
📈 Result Visualization
Developed key metrics such as "Average Score", "Pass Rate", and "Top Performers" on the dashboard.
Created various visual representations (e.g., bar charts, pie charts, scatter plots) to illustrate findings.
Used slicers and filters in Power BI to allow interactive exploration of the data.
